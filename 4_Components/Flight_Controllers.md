# üéÆ Flight Controllers (FC)

A **flight controller (FC)** is the central unit that controls the drone's flight behavior by processing data from sensors and executing stabilization algorithms in real time.

---

## üß† Core Functions:
- **Stabilization:** Uses IMU (gyroscope + accelerometer) to balance the drone
- **Command interpretation:** Processes inputs from RC or mission planner
- **Motor output control:** Sends signals to ESCs to adjust propeller speeds
- **Sensor fusion:** Combines GPS, barometer, magnetometer, etc.
- **Autonomous flight:** Executes missions with GPS waypoints and failsafes

## üß© Internal Sensors:
| Sensor | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Gyroscope | Measures angular velocity |
| Accelerometer | Detects tilt & motion |
| Magnetometer | Acts as a compass |
| Barometer | Measures altitude |
| GPS | Positioning and navigation |
