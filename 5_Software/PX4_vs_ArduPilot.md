## 📊 Quick Comparison

| Feature | PX4 | ArduPilot |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Programming Language | C++ | C++ |
| Supported Hardware | Pixhawk, Holybro, CUAV, etc. | Pixhawk, Cube, Matek, etc. |
| Ground Station | QGroundControl | Mission Planner, QGC, others |
| Best For | Research, Modular Robotics, ROS integration | Reliability, Agriculture, Industrial UAVs |
| Tuning Interface | QGroundControl | Mission Planner |
| Community | Modern, research-driven | Mature, large user base |
| Development Style | Modular, layered | Feature-rich monolith |
| ROS2 Support | Native support (ROS2 integration) | Supported via MAVROS |
| Supported Vehicles | Multirotor, Fixed-wing, VTOL, UGVs, Submarines | Same + Boats, Rovers, Planes |

## 🔍 PX4 Highlights

- Best used in research + academic setups (like PX4-SITL, ROS2, PX4-Autopilot)
- Easier to integrate with **Gazebo simulation**, **MAVROS**, and **micro-ROS**
- Clean, layered architecture—great for devs

---

## 🧰 ArduPilot Highlights

- Used in **agriculture**, **delivery**, **industrial** drones
- Very robust in **GPS-denied** environments
- More mature with **tons of real-world flight hours**
- Widely adopted by drone companies in India (e.g., ideaForge)
