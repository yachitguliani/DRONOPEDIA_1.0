# 🧬 Wing Shapes in Drones

In fixed-wing drones, **wing shape** plays a critical role in determining lift, drag, stability, and flight efficiency. Selecting the right wing shape depends on the drone’s mission and performance goals.

## ✈️ Common Wing Shapes

| Shape | Characteristics | Best For |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Rectangular** | Simple to build, predictable stall | Trainer drones |
| **Tapered** | More efficient than rectangular | Medium-range drones |
| **Elliptical** | Smooth airflow, low drag | High-efficiency, premium UAVs |
| **Delta** | High speed, stable at high angles | Military, supersonic craft |
| **Swept-back** | Better at high speed, less drag | VTOL/fighter drones |
| **Flying Wing** | All-lift design, minimal drag | Stealth drones (e.g., B-2 Spirit) |

## 🌪️ Factors Influenced by Wing Shape

- **Lift-to-drag ratio**
- **Stall behavior**
- **Maneuverability**
- **Stability in turbulent air**
- **Payload efficiency**

## 🧪 Example: eBee vs Predator

| Drone | Wing Type | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **eBee X** | Rectangular/Tapered | Surveying & Mapping |
| **MQ-1 Predator** | Swept Wing | Long endurance military |
