## 🚁 Why I Built This

I wanted to create a single, open-source reference for:
- Everyone building their **first drone**
- Engineers trying to understand the **"why" behind each part**
- Me — Rusty — so I could give back to the community that helped me fly 🙌

> ✨ Whether you're prepping for a drone job, a capstone, or a mission — Droneopedia is for you.
