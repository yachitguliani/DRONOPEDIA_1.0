# 🌍 Applications of Drones

Drones (UAVs) are being adopted across nearly every major industry due to their flexibility, low cost, and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. Here are some major domains where drones are changing the game:

---

## 📸 1. Aerial Photography & Videography

Used in filmmaking, real estate, events, and journalism.

- DJI Phantom / Mavic used worldwide
- Enables never-seen-before aerial perspectives

---

## 🌾 2. Agriculture & Crop Monitoring

- NDVI mapping using multispectral cameras
- Precision spraying and seed dropping
- Livestock and irrigation monitoring

---

## 🛡️ 3. Defense & Surveillance

- Real-time reconnaissance in hostile zones
- Border patrol and crowd surveillance
- Weaponized drones (UCAVs)

---

## 🏗️ 4. Infrastructure Inspection

- Power lines, pipelines, wind turbines, solar farms
- Reduces risk by replacing manual inspections

---

## 🧭 5. Search & Rescue / Disaster Management

- Mapping disaster-hit areas using thermal drones
- Delivering supplies in floods and earthquakes
- Crowd monitoring in large events

---

## 📦 6. Delivery & Logistics

- Drone delivery by Amazon, Zomato, Zipline
- Blood and medicine delivery in rural areas
- BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) operations

---

## 🚁 7. Urban Air Mobility (UAM)

- Future tech: Air taxis and eVTOL drones
- Companies like Joby, Archer, and Volocopter are leading

---

## ⚙️ 8. Research, Mapping & Education

- Environmental mapping (forests, glaciers)
- 3D terrain modeling
- Used by students, hobbyists, and researchers globally
