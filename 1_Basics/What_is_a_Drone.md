# 🤖 What is a Drone?

A **drone**, also known as an **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)**, is an aircraft that operates **without a human pilot on board**. It is either controlled **remotely** by an operator or flies **autonomously** using onboard sensors and pre-programmed software.

## 🧠 Core Components of a Drone

1. **Frame** – The body that holds everything together  
2. **Motors + Propellers** – Provide lift and movement  
3. **Flight Controller (FC)** – The drone’s brain; handles stabilization  
4. **Battery** – Powers the drone  
5. **ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)** – Control motor speeds  
6. **GPS / IMU / Barometer** – For location, orientation, and altitude sensing  
7. **Transmitter + Receiver** – For manual control (RC)  
8. **Payload** – Cameras, sensors, or delivery mechanisms

## 🧭 Types of Drones (By Design)

- **Multirotor** – Quadcopters, hexacopters; great for stability and vertical lift  
- **Fixed-wing** – Fly like planes; energy efficient, long range  
- **VTOL (Vertical Takeoff & Landing)** – Hybrid of both; advanced use  
- **Single-rotor** – Helicopter-like; more complex, heavier payloads

## 📡 Types of Drones (By Autonomy)

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Remotely Piloted** | Controlled by human via RC or ground station |
| **Semi-Autonomous** | Auto hover/navigation with human supervision |
| **Fully Autonomous** | Pre-programmed missions, dynamic route changes |

## ✈️ Drone vs UAV vs UAS

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Drone** | Common name (informal) |
| **UAV** | Unmanned Aerial Vehicle |
| **UAS** | Unmanned Aircraft System (includes ground control, communication systems, and UAV) |

> TL;DR: A drone is more than just flying—it’s a full system of electronics, code, control, and innovation.
