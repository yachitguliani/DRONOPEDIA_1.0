# ✈️ Fixed-Wing Drones

A **fixed-wing drone** uses a rigid wing surface (like a traditional airplane) to generate lift. Unlike quadcopters, they don’t rely on propellers for lift but for forward thrust.

---

## 🧠 How They Work
- Forward motion generates **aerodynamic lift**
- Uses **rudders, elevators, and ailerons** (if advanced) for control
- Propeller or jet pushes it forward

---

## ✅ Advantages
- Long flight time (1–2 hours typical)
- Covers large distances efficiently
- High payload capacity
- Ideal for large-scale surveillance or mapping

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Cannot hover or take off vertically
- Needs a runway, catapult, or hand-launch
- Less maneuverable than rotary drones

---

## 📦 Use Cases
- Aerial mapping (agriculture, mining)
- Search & rescue over large areas
- Fixed surveillance missions
- Military ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance)

---

## 🚀 Examples
- **eBee X** by senseFly – popular in agriculture
- **MQ-9 Reaper** – high-altitude military drone
- **Parrot Disco-Pro** – commercial mapping drone
